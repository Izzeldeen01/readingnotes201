# Introductory HTML and JavaScript 
## HTML Structure
  HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning. To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

## Extra Markup
Each HTML file should begin with DOCTYPE to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using. Comments are not visible for the user and they can be added between (!– –). ID attribute is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. An RSE is like a little window that has been cut into your page — and in that window you can see another page. The height attribute specifies the height of the iframe in pixels and the width attribute specifies how wide the iframes should be in pixels. The meta element lives inside the (head) element and contains information about that web page. Inside the meta element we can find some attributes with their contents such as description, keywords, robots and author. pragma can be used to indicate when the page should expire.

## HTML5 Layout
 HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The (header) and (footer) elements can be used for: The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site. A header for an individual (article) or    within the page. A section element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading. The figure element contains any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article (not just images)

 ## Process & Design
 Steps to start designing a website. You should know who is the site for (Target Audience) are they individuals or Companies? Then, you should know why people visit your website. A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in. Visual Hierarchy can get across your key message and help users find what they are looking for.

## Java Script
In computer programming, each physical thing in the world can be represented as an object. Each object can have its own properties, events and methods. The events, methods, and properties of an object all relate to each other. Using the document object, you can access and change what content users see on the page and respond to how they interact with it. All major browsers use a JavaScript interpreter to translate your instructions into instructions the computer can follow.
