to group together sections of a page.
*  Browsers display pages in normal  flow     unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
* The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
* Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
* Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
* CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
