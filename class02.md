* Evaluation of a single value of expressions.

## Decisions and Loops

* Operating contrast (===, !==, ==, !=, =, <, >, <=, =>), Comparative operators Two operands are used to compare. 
* You can combine more than one logical operator Comparison operators set.
* Operators set. Whether... You can execute one set of code other statements
