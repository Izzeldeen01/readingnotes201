# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables
## Domain Modeling:
- Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model. As you read this article, type out and run all code samples you come across. Do not copy and paste. Writing out and testing your code will help you remember how to implement domain models in JavaScript later .
## Tables
- Tables are applied to the site by the feature (table) Page.
- A row-by-row table is drawn. Every line is generated The factor (tr).
- There are multiple cells within each row The (td) element(or (th) is represented if it is a Header).
- You can render more than one row of table cells Or column that uses the properties of rowspan and colspan.
- The table can be divided into one for long tables (thead), (the fucker), and (tfoot)

## Functions, Methods, and Objects :
- Functions will group a set of similar functions Together declarations that are a single job.
- Functions will take settings (informatiorJ necessary). And will return a value to do their job).
- An object is a set of functions and variables Reflect something for you from the universe. You represent something.
- Variables are regarded as characteristics of the material Object; attributes are known as object methods.
- Online browsers enforce both artifacts. the browser window and the loaded document Window of the browser.
- JavaScript has many integrated artifacts, including Digit, String, Algebra, and Date. Their features Methods have script-writing functionalities.
- Arrays and artifacts should be used for dynamic data production Sets of sets (and both can contain the other).
